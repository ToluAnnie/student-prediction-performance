# student-performance-prediction
## Group name: NumPy
### Topic: Student Performance Prediction

##### Project Overview: This the first Premeire project of Numpy group in the the HDSC Winter '23 internship. the project is concerned with the use of Regression Model in the Sci-kit learn library to predict student performance in a portuguese secondary school,consequently the trained model will be used to predict the performance of a new student whose data was not used to train the Regression Model. The data for this model was obtain from Kaggle with the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-set

##### Dependencies : To run the cells of this project it's necessary that one has jupyter notebook or any other ".ipynb" compactible software like google colab, in addition to that, this project was created with python libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn which can be pip installed.

##### Architecure and Model training: In this project, Machine Learning Models like Linear Regression , Decision Trees Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression were trained to predict the student performace, but the Random Forest Regressor Model was found to have the least Error value.

##### Perforamance Evaluation: The Metrics used to evaluate the Model includes: Mean_Absolut_Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and the Root Square score.
